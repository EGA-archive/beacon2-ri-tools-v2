The use of public human genomic background combined with the in-silico insertion of real disease-causing variants enable a representative dataset for testing purposes without facing ethical and legal issues associated with the use of human sensitive data. This project aims to help develop technical implementations for rare disease data integration, analysis, discovery,  and federated access.", "externalUrl": "https://metadata.ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001008392", "id": "EGAD00001008392", "name": "Rare Disease Synthetic Dataset", "updateDateTime": "2025-04-14 23:18:43.985 +0200", "datasetId": "Rare-diseases", "_id": "acc86eaa4097559e0484948478de3a2dbcb3489aeb36a7e24555537a4f179840"}]
